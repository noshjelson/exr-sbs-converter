## üîç Troubleshooting

### "Python not found" or "Can't run sbs_gui.py"

**Problem:** Python isn't installed or not in PATH

**Solutions:**
1. **Reinstall Python** - Make sure to check "Add Python to PATH"
2. **Use PowerShell version** - Right-click `Convert-SBS-Interactive.ps1` ‚Üí "Run with PowerShell"
3. **Manual PATH fix** - Add Python to Windows PATH manually

### "oiiotool executable not found"

**Problem:** OpenImageIO tools aren't installed

**Solutions:**
1. **Use PowerShell version** - It handles this automatically
2. **Install OpenImageIO manually** (see Method 2 above)
3. **Use the bundled version** (coming soon)

### "Nothing to convert" or "No shots selected"

**Problem:** No EXR files found

**Solutions:**
1. **Check your folder** - Make sure it contains `.exr` files
2. **Check file names** - Files should end with `.exr`
3. **Try a different folder** - Test with a folder you know has EXR files

### Tool crashes or freezes

**Problem:** GUI issues or system conflicts

**Solutions:**
1. **Use PowerShell version** - More reliable
2. **Restart your computer** - Clear any system issues
3. **Check Windows updates** - Make sure you're up to date
4. **Try command-line version** - `Convert-SBS-CLI.ps1`

### "Access denied" or "Permission denied"

**Problem:** Windows security blocking the tool

**Solutions:**
1. **Run as Administrator** - Right-click ‚Üí "Run as administrator"
2. **Check antivirus** - Temporarily disable if needed
3. **Move to different folder** - Try `C:\temp\` instead of Desktop
